study	phs000464	phs000464	TARGET: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Expansion Phase 2 and Acute Leukemia of Ambiguous Lineage (ALAL) Phase 3	TARGET_ALL_P2_P3	There are 175 fully characterized patient cases with relapsed precursor B-cell ALL (all tumor/normal pairs, 85 with relapse sample as well) that will make up Phase II of the TARGET ALL dataset, each with gene expression, tumor and paired normal copy number analyses, and comprehensive next-generation sequencing to include whole genome sequencing, mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq. Subsets of these cases will also have methylation and/or whole exome sequencing data available as well. There are additionally a large number of cases with partial molecular characterization making this a large and informative genomic dataset.
